## Basic concepts
* `access` - in order to change something you an access.
* `configuration` - you want your setup to persist in time on each boot.
* `session` - you want several typical layouts to work with something.
* `runtime`
### Shell
* `interactive shell` - receive *user* commands, process it and gives the result.
* `system shell` - used silently to run system scripts where interaction with the user may not the case.
* `sh` - POSIX standard scripting language. Bash, zsh, dash, etc trying to suuport/comply to this standard. That simply means they can interpret .sh scripts.

### Shell history

### Unix history
Unix system created at AT&T Bell Labs. Written in C. It is "Self-contained" system. Lincences were sold to commercial companies IBM (AIX), Apple (OS X), HP (HP-UX), etc. Now is under jurisdiction of (maintained by) The Open Group. It's still alive (Solaris).

* `self-contained system` - system which has all the environment: compilers, debugers, documentations, etc.

Then, BSD appeared to substitute all the legal restrictions. Designed under Berkley University. It also self-contained. It has many descendants: RHEL, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. They are not "Unix" systems but "Unix-like". To use word Unix you should pay a fees, etc to Open Group. 

* `unix-like system` - definition

Finally, Linux appeared to put all dots on i as separate project. It's a kernel *only*. Self-contained systems are *distributions* in this context which are Ubuntu, Debian, etc..

### Unix-like system consists of
* kernel
* shell
* fs
* dev environment
* commands
* documentation
