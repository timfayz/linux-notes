Main definitions
* *Character* - the smallest element of writing that has a meaning (`a`, `b`, `,`, `$`, etc)
```
[            256-65536] - ISO 10646, UCS, Universal Character Set or just Unicode (16/32bit)
[     128-255]          - ISO 8859-1, KOI8(R/U) (8bit)
[0-127]                 - US-ASCII or just "classic" ASCII (7bit)
First 0-65536(0xFFFF) code points are "basic multilingual plane" (BMP), 
all other are "supplementary characters"
```

## First approximation (basic)
```
/boot
/dev
/etc
/sys
/proc
/usr
```

## Unsroted
```
(kernel space)
[syslinux/grub] -> [vmlinuz] -> [initramfs] -> [runit] ->

(user space)
[login (/car/utmp,/etc/passwd)] -> [tmux [slstatus]]
-> [Xorg] -> [dwm] -> [st]
or
[agetty*] -> [login] -> [sh]

sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/tmux $USER
```

## Useful tools

## Important Linux conventions
```
$ - ordinary user
# - root

./ - current dir
../ - parent dir

programd - `d` stands for daemon (background process/service)
/path/to/program.conf.d/ - `.conf.d` is pool of configuration files which is typicaly loaded during the program start
```
