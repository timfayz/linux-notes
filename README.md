# Linux Notes
This is how I become aweare of what's going on in the Linux

### Table Of Content
* [Prepare Linux](https://github.com/timfayz/simply-linux) <br>
Get hands dirty. Bootstraping yourself. Before extending the system become good user of it.
    * Search and location
    * Documentation and help
* [PC Boot Process](pages/pc-boot.md) <br>
Understand how your PC booting up regardless of the OS you use.
* Linux Internals <br>
Organization & management

### Little TODO

### Definition of being able to manage
**manage** Linux program means _know how to_:
* show its location
* show its permissions, user, group
* change its state during 
    * **first boot** (using configuration)
    * **runtime** (using command line or reloading configs)
    * **compile time** (by recompilation)
* list its dependecies (ldd)
* list network ports it uses
* list systemcalls it calls
* measure performance (profiling) 
* show the platform it was compiled against
* use it (flags & options) under CLI
* show how much memory and CPU it utilize
* read it man page

Main questions:
1. Which programs manage smthg?
1. Where they are stored?
1. Where their configs are stored?
1. How to change them?
1. How to check the changes?
1. (if defaults hardcoded) Can I recompile program to change its defaults?
1. (if nothing found) What the syscalls/libraries it uses?
1. Can I write my own program to do what I want?

(kernel space)
[syslinux/grub] -> [vmlinuz] -> [initramfs] -> [runit] ->

(user space)
[login (/car/utmp,/etc/passwd)] -> [tmux [slstatus]]
-> [Xorg] -> [dwm] -> [st]
or
[agetty*] -> [login] -> [sh]

sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/tmux $USER
