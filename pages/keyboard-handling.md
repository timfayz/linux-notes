## Keyboard handling
Roughly speaking, the picture is this: the keyboard produces scancodes, the scancodes are assembled into keycodes (one unique code for each key), and keycodes are converted to tty input characters using the kernel keymaps. After that, the normal `stty` processing takes place, just as for any other terminal.

The mapping uses two levels of indirection, from keycode+modifier combination (with three modifiers: shift, control, alt) to keysym and from keysym to string (character or escape sequence). The set of keysyms is fixed, so if you want to define custom combinations you'll need to use existing keysyms that aren't otherwise used such as F13, F14, …

### X Window System
The X server reads input events through a device file, for example `/dev/input/eventNN`

In practice, you'll want to configure fonts in two ways:

    For older-style programs: the font directories are listed via FontPath directives in xorg.conf and can be manipulated with xset fp commands by the user running X. If you install new fonts, you may need to run mkfontdir.
    For newer-style programs, including all Gtk (Gnome, etc.) and Qt (KDE, etc.) programs: fonts are in the directories indicated by <dir> directives in /etc/fonts/fonts.conf, ~/.fonts.conf and a few other places. See the fontconfig documentation for more information. If you install new fonts, you may need to run fc-cache.

```
There are two ways to display a character:

* Server-side rendering: the application tells the X server “draw this string in this font at this position”. The font resides on the X server.
* Client-side rendering: the application builds an image that represents the character in a font that it chooses, then tells the X server to display that image.

Fontconfig is a library designed to provide a list of available fonts to applications, and also for configuration for how fonts get rendered. The FreeType library `freetype2` renders the fonts, based on this configuration. 
Though Fontconfig is the standard in modern Linux, some applications rely on the original method of font selection and display, the X Logical Font Description. 

Both cairo and Xft respect fontconfig settings and use Freetype2 for glyph rendering and Xrender for compositing. So, when it comes to text rendering in X11, they both do the same thing, but with different drawing models and suitable for their respective APIs, of course. This is why the output of the xft and cairo backends in pango looks the same.

EDIT: The following statements are part of my own research again, not in IRC.

Also, Xft and Freetype2 are not strictly the same. Xft uses Freetype2 to provide text rendering for X11 (as does cairo), while Freetype2 is agnostic of any graphical environment (well, that one is kind of obvious in hindsight, if you look at the package dependencies).

#### Programs
* `Xft, freetype2, fontcofig`
* `xset q` shows current X11 properties
* `mkfontdir` generates font index storing aliases into `font.alias` (bitmap) and `font.scale` (vector)

#### Files
* `/usr/share/fonts/*/fonts.{alias,scale}`

### Linux Console
In a Linux console, keycodes are mapped to escape sequences according to the console keymap.

As for the Linux console, it has its own keyboard layouts which are stored in /usr/share/keymaps and loaded with the loadkeys command. When in the BIOS and earlier boot loader stages, including GRUB2, the keyboard mapping is whatever the number the BIOS decides to map the key to.

In Linux, several devices can be used as system console: a virtual terminal, serial port, USB serial port, VGA in text-mode, framebuffer.

#### Programs
* `setfont`
* `showconsolefont`
#### Files
`/usr/share/kbd/consolefonts` is the default font directory.
`/usr/share/kbd/unimaps` is the default directory for Unicode maps.
`/usr/share/kbd/consoletrans` is the default directory for screen mappings.  The default font is a file `default*.psfu.gz`
